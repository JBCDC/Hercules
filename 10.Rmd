**Cerberus, Guardian of Hades**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke with radiant breath:
“The light of life must pierce through death.
The son of man, the son of God,
Must walk where shades and shadows trod.
Through the tenth great Portal go,
To free the chained one far below.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
Lost am I in light supernal,
Yet on that light I turn my back.
Into the depths, through night eternal,
I walk the dark, the soul’s own path.

[Verse 2]
The Master touched his brow with flame,
A vision rose, a voice, a name:
Prometheus bound on rock of pain,
A vulture feeding, blood like rain.

“Go down,” he said, “to Hades’ keep,
Where shadows wander, where sorrows weep.
Break his chains, release his breath,
Bring life’s light into halls of death.”

[Verse 3]
Downward, downward, Hercules trod,
Through choking dark, through realms of sod.
The Stygian river barred his way,
But Charon ferried him, pale with dismay.

Through mist and maze, through phantom cries,
He faced Medusa’s serpent eyes.
Her form dissolved, a phantom’s snare,
He pressed ahead through the poisoned air.

[Chorus]
Lost am I in light supernal,
Yet on that light I turn my back.
Into the depths, through night eternal,
I walk the dark, the soul’s own path.

[Bridge]
Before the throne of Hades grim,
He spoke with voice both strong and dim:
“I seek to free Prometheus bound,
Whose cries of torment still resound.”

The king replied: “Then face the hound,
Cerberus guards this shadowed ground.
With naked hands, if you prevail,
The chains of torment you may unseal.”

[Verse 4]
Three heads roared with serpents curled,
The guardian beast of the underworld.
It leapt, it clawed, with fury wild,
But Hercules seized its throat, defiled.

He held it fast with iron will,
Till raging strength grew faint and still.
The monster bowed, subdued at last,
The hero’s trial was overpassed.

[Verse 5]
He found the titan, chained in stone,
Prometheus bound, yet not alone.
With mighty hands he broke the ties,
And raised the captive toward the skies.

Back through the dark he bore his way,
Till dawn revealed the living day.
The Master met him, calm and bright:
“The world of dark now holds the light.”

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
Lost am I in light supernal,
Yet on that light I turn my back.
Into the depths, through night eternal,
I walk the dark, the soul’s own path.

[Outro (gentle, solemn)]
The chains are broken, the captive free,
The light shines now in dark’s decree.
The tenth great Portal’s work is done,
Rest, O Hercules, victorious son.
