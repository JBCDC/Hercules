**The Capture of the Hind**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke in the Council of flame:
“Where walks the son of man, the son of God by name?
He learned from the trials of labors before,
Now test his wisdom, his heart at the core.
Let him discern which voice is true,
Among the many that call and woo.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I build a lighted house and therein dwell,
Through shadow and trial I know it well.
The voices fade, the heart is still,
The house is founded by steadfast will.

[Verse 2]
Before the fourth Portal Hercules stood,
Silent, listening, intent and good.
Beyond lay the temple, radiant, bright,
The Sun-God’s shrine on the mountain height.

Upon a hill the hind appeared,
Golden-horned, both swift and feared.
Then Artemis spoke from the moon’s white glow:
“The hind is mine, disturb it not so.”

[Verse 3]
Diana leapt with her sandals of flame,
“The hind is mine, I too make claim!”
The hero stood, amazed to hear,
Two maidens quarrel for the deer.

Then came a voice, commanding, clear:
“The hind belongs not to maidens here.
It dwells with God, whose shrine you see,
Bring it there, and set it free.”

[Chorus]
I build a lighted house and therein dwell,
Through shadow and trial I know it well.
The voices fade, the heart is still,
The house is founded by steadfast will.

[Bridge]
For a year he chased through forest and plain,
Through desert wilds, through shadow and rain.
Each time deceived by the maidens’ art,
Yet still he followed with patient heart.

At last by a pool, in the grasses deep,
He found the hind, at rest, asleep.
With steady hand and arrow slight,
He touched the deer, it ceased its flight.

[Verse 4]
He clasped it close against his breast,
“I sought, I strove, I did not rest.
Through forest dark and desert bare,
At last the hind is mine to bear!”

But a voice replied from the Council high:
“The hind is God’s, not thine, O my.
Take it onward, to the shrine above,
Where all may share in the light of love.”

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
I build a lighted house and therein dwell,
Through shadow and trial I know it well.
The voices fade, the heart is still,
The house is founded by steadfast will.

[Outro (gentle, fading)]
The hind is free in the temple’s light,
The house is built, the dwelling bright.
The son of man, a son of God,
Walks on the path his brothers trod.
