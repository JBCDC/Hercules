<p><strong>They Stand, They Rest, They See</strong></p>
<p>They come and stand amidst the storm, <br>
’Mid forms of beauty, dread, and harm.<br>
They turn not here, they turn not there,<br>
But face the Light, serene and fair.<br>
Through mind the streaming radiance flows,<br>
The fog dissolves, the darkness goes.<br></p>
<p>They stand, they rest, they see the true,<br>
The Light made clear, the world made new.<br>
Through heart and eye, through mind and hand,<br>
They serve in silence—still they stand.<br></p>
<p>They come and rest from outward strife,<br>
A deeper work becomes their life.<br>
Within the heart a stillness grows,<br>
A beam of peace, resplendent, glows.<br>
The veils that hide the Real depart,<br>
The Light shines forth from quiet heart<br>.</p>
<p>They stand, they rest, they see the true,<br>
The Light made clear, the world made new.<br>
Through heart and eye, through mind and hand,<br>
They serve in silence—still they stand.<br></p>
<p>They come and see with vision’s eye,<br>
The truth behind the world’s disguise.<br>
The glamour fades, the mists are gone,<br>
The Beautiful, the Real, shines on.<br>
Through Buddhi’s gaze the power streams,<br>
To pierce illusion’s fleeting dreams.<br></p>
<p>They stand, they rest, they see the true,<br>
The Light made clear, the world made new.<br>
Through heart and eye, through mind and hand,<br>
They serve in silence—still they stand.<br></p>
<p>They stand, they rest, they watch with care,<br>
Their service flows through silent prayer.<br>
No clamour loud, no restless hand,<br>
But Light is spread across the land.<br>
Through lives made clear, through hearts set free,<br>
They serve the world eternally.<br></p>
<p>Adapted from the book <em>Discipleship in the New Age</em>, Vol. 1, by Alice A. Bailey (pp.317-318), published by the Lucis Trust. Musical adaptation by <a href="https://becerraj.substack.com/p/trained-observers">José Becerra</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Old Commentary, in speaking of the work of those whose dharma it is to dissipate world glamour, uses the following expressions:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They come and stand. Within the midst of whirling forms—some of a beauty rare and some of horror and despair—they stand. They look not here or there but, with their faces turned towards the light, they stand. Thus through their minds the pure light streams to dissipate the fogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They come and rest. They cease their outer labours, pausing to do a different work. Within their hearts is rest. They run not here and there, but form a point of peace and rest. That which upon the surface veils and hides the real begins to disappear and from the heart at rest a beam of dissipating force projects, blends with the shining light and then the mists of man’s creation disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They come and they observe. They own the eye of vision; likewise they own the eye of right direction of the [Page 318] needed force. They see the glamour of the world, and seeing, note behind it all the true, the beautiful, the real. Thus through the eye of Buddhi comes the power to drive away the veiling swirling glamours of that glamorous world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They stand, they rest, and they observe. Such are their lives and such the service that they render to the world of men.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Quotes from <em>Discipleship in the New Age</em>, Vol. 1</p>
<p>To D. L. R.:</p>
<p>Your rays therefore are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The egoic ray—the first Ray of Will or Power.</li>
<li>The personality ray—the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge. [Page 316]</li>
<li>The ray of the mental body—the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge.</li>
<li>The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.</li>
<li>The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Magic.</li>
</ul>
<p>August 1936</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been a year of change for you, my warrior brother, and the result has been that there is less of the warrior in you [Page 630] and more of the disciple upon the Way of Light. Your ivory tower is still there and stands in beauty real. Perhaps it will never be destroyed and maybe it will turn into a haven of refuge for others. Its doors stand wide open and you are often not to be found within your tower but are busy elsewhere in the service of your fellowmen. Keep the door open and pass and re-pass with freedom, using your tower as a “Tower of Silence” for the lower self, as a place of entrance into the “Secret Place of the Most High,” and as a “Temple of Refuge” into which the tired, the bewildered and the lonely may pass—there to be aided and strengthened. You have much wisdom and also the first ray capacity to take a stand upon principle. For decades, these two (wisdom and principle) have expressed themselves as far as your personality will permit. But within you, you have much deep innate love which must—under the process of balancing to which all true disciples are subjected—have more definite expression. Before you speak the words of power and of wisdom (which you speak with such facility and truth from the storehouse of a long experience), you must pour out the love of your heart upon those who turn to you for light and strength. Men today have need of love. Had I told you this five years ago, you might have believed, but you would not have understood. Now you understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have often pointed out to this group of my disciples, the tendering of constant personal advice cannot go on forever. There is a limit to what can be assimilated and much remains yet to be worked out in daily unfoldment. I can, however, give to you and your fellow disciples much that is of group import and significance and by this means familiarise disciples with the rules of that group activity which must govern unfoldment and service during the coming New Age. I can give the techniques of the future. I would ask you to brood much upon the work of the new groups of disciples as they form the seed groups wherein the technique of the New Age may be expressed. Endeavour to get the picture of the future work clearly in your mind in its threefold aspects. Brood on the mental purpose behind all Ashrams, and on my plan for my Ashram. I say “my plan” advisedly, my brother, as I am asking for your understanding of the thing which I am seeking [Page 631] to do. I am planning for the future and in line with the Plan. I, your friend and teacher, am definitely preparing you and your co-disciples for certain possible and even imminent expansion of consciousness. Later I will ask you to tune in on the heart life of this particular group in my Ashram, upon its desire-aspiration life and this, through the medium of your desire-astral body. When the purpose and the desire of the group (as it endeavours to tune in on my plan) begins to mature in your mind, then there will be inevitably produced, upon the physical plane, certain cooperations and activities which will appear with clarity to your vision. What these will be, will later emerge, but the time is not yet.</p>
