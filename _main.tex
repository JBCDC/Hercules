May the Holy Ones
Whose disciple I am
show me the light I seek;
give me the strong aid
of Their compassion
and Their wisdom.

There is a peace
which passeth understanding;
it abides in the hearts
of those who live in the Eternal.

There is a power
which maketh all things new;
it lives and moves
in those who know the Self as one.

May that peace brood over us,
that power uplift us
till we stand
where the One Initiator is invoked,
till we see
His star shine forth!

\textbf{The Affirmation of the Disciple}

I am a point of light
Within a greater Light.
I am a strand of loving energy
Within the stream of love divine.
I am a point of sacrificial Fire,
Focused within the fiery Will of God.
And thus, I stand.

I am a way
By which men may achieve.
I am a source of strength,
Enabling them to stand.
I am a beam of light,
Shining upon their way.
And thus, I stand.

And standing thus revolve
And tread this way
The ways of men,
And know the ways of God.
And thus, I stand.

\textbf{Aquarian Service Activities}

\textbf{The Invocation of Devas}

by Vicente Beltrán Anglada

We will work as a group inspired by the spiritual Hierarchy, and aided by the powerful energies of the Lord of Aquarius, to facilitate physical healing, emotional stability and spiritual understanding. Each one should choose the specific area of service to wholeheartedly devote his/her attention.

The \href{https://www.agni-yoga.org/AMS.htm}{Aquarian Mantra of Synthesis} will synthesize the joint effort to invoke the inner power needed for the work.

May the Liberating Light of Lord Buddha
The Infinite Love of the Spirit of Peace
And the Indefinable Power of the Avatar of Synthesis
Restore the Plan of God on Earth.

It is a very powerful mantra, approved by the spiritual Hierarchy, whose specific purpose is to invoke the energies potentiated by the Constellation of Aquarius, for us to draw from that cosmic source the power needed to accomplish our work in the area of service of our choosing and according to the purity of our intention.

This mantra should preferably be used at 7 a.m. (local time). It should be pronounced three times, orally, if the etheric plane is the object of our service, or mentally, for the emotional or mental planes.

\textbf{A. Physical Healing} (invocation of the violet devas)

After saying the Mantra of Unification (at 7 in the morning), and after subjectively linking up with the individual to be healed, say the following mantra three times:

May the Force of the Great Magic Triangle
And the Energies of the Healing Devas
Act upon {[}name{]}

while visualizing a golden stream of energy flowing through the diseased organ(s). Be patient and keep your hope. Persevere in your purpose even in the face of apparent failure.

\textbf{B. Emotional Equilibrium}
(to cure obsessions, epilepsy, habits, astral possessions, etc.)

After mentally saying the Mantra of Unification (at 7 in the morning), and after subjectively linking up with the individual to be healed, mentally say the following mantra three times:

May the Force of the Great Magic Triangle
And the Energies of the Devas of Equilibrium
Act upon {[}name{]}

while visualizing a light-yellow stream of energy bathing the whole aura of the affected individual up and down, taking away all noxious impurities. With practice, the visualization may be so vivid as to actually see the person in front of the healer, while letting the pure energies of compassion flow between healer and patient.

\textbf{C. Spiritual Understanding}

This is a most impersonal service activity, reserved for trained esoteric workers. The mantra to be used by those intuitively called for this Hierarchical work is:

May the Force of the Great Magic Triangle
And the Energies of the Solar Angels
Act upon {[}name{]}

A deeper and more sustained approach is needed. The mind should be maintained in an invocative state of profound, serene expectation, so that the Solar Angels (the living Force driving the evolution of the Human Kingdom) may use the path created by our intentions and visualizations to impact individuals, groups and organizations. The color associated with this activity is deep blue.

\textbf{Preliminary Rules for Radiatory Healing}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  By an act of the will, after making your own quick, conscious alignment, link up as a soul with the souls of your group brothers. Then link up with their minds, and then with their emotional natures. Do this by the use of the imagination, realising that energy follows thought and that the linking process is inevitable, if correctly done. You can then function as a group. Then forget about the group relation and concentrate upon the work to be done.
\item
  Within yourself, then, link soul and brain and gather together the forces of love that are to be found in your aura and focus yourself and all that you have to offer within the head, picturing yourself as a radiant centre of energy or a point of vivid light. This light is to be projected upon the patient through the ajna centre between the eyes.
\item
  Then say the following group mantram:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
``With purity of motive, inspired by a loving heart, we offer ourselves for this work of healing. This offer we make as a group and to the one we seek to heal.''
\end{quote}

As you do this, visualise the linking process going on. See it as moving lines of living light substance, linking you to your brothers on the one hand, and to the patient on the other. See these lines going out from you to the heart centre of the group and to the patient. But work ever from the ajna centre until instructed to do differently. In this way, the ajna centre and the heart centre of all the persons involved will be closely interrelated. You see here where the value of visualisation comes in. It is in reality the etheric externalisation of the creative imagination. Think this last sentence out.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  Then use thought, directed thought, for a brief moment and think of the one you seek to heal, linking up with him, and focussing your attention on him so that he becomes a reality in your consciousness and close to you. When you are aware what the physical difficulty is, then simply recall it to your mind and then dismiss it. Forget now the details of the work, such as the group, yourself and the difficulty of the patient, and concentrate upon the type of force you are going to handle, which is, in this case and for the present, second ray force, the force of love. What I am here giving out is an adaptation of the second ray method of healing, arranged for beginners.
\item
  Feel a deep love pouring into you. Regard it as substantial light which you can and will manipulate. Then send it out as a stream of radiant light from the ajna centre and direct it through the medium of your hands to the patient. In doing this, hold the hands before the eyes, palms outward and with the hacks of the hands next to the eyes and about six inches away from the face. In this way, the stream which is issuing from the ajna centre, becomes divided into two and pours out through the two hands. It is thus directed on to the patient. Visualise it as pouring out {[}Page 105{]} and sense the patient receiving it. As you do this, say aloud in a low voice:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
``May the love of the One Soul, focused in this group, radiate upon you, my brother, and permeate every part of your body---healing, soothing, strengthening; and dissipating all that hinders service and good health.''
\end{quote}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Say this slowly and deliberately, believing in the results. See that no thought-power or will-power enters into the stream of healing energy, but only a concentrated radiating love. The use of the visualising faculty and of the creative imagination, plus a sense of deep and steadfast love, will keep the mind and the will in abeyance.

I would emphasise the urgent necessity for complete silence and reticence in relation to all healing work. Never let it be known by anyone that you are working in this manner, and never mention to anyone the names of those you are seeking to aid. Do not discuss the patient under treatment even among yourselves. If this basic rule of silence is not kept, it will indicate that you are not yet ready for this work and should discontinue it. This injunction is far more important than you can realise; for speech and discussion not only tend to deflect and dissipate force, but violate a fundamental rule which all healers are trained to keep, and even the medical profession on the physical plane follows the same general procedure.

{[}Verse 1{]}
I'm prepared for the road.
All that was mine, I renounce, I renounce.
You will take it, my friends,
And now for the last time, I shall survey my house

Once more
I shall view my possessions
Upon images of friends, I shall look.
For the last time, I know
That here nothing of mine remains, anymore.

{[}Verse 2{]}
Possessions and all that impeded me
Freely I'm giving away
Without them I shall be more free
Before the one who calls me, liberated,
I shall appear I shall appear.

{[}Verse 3{]}
Now once more I'll survey the house,
View once more that from which I'm released.
Free, liberated and firm in thought,
The images, my former things, do not confuse me.

{[}Verse 4{]}
I'm going, I'm hurrying, but once more
For the last time,
I shall survey all that I've left.
All that I've left.
All that I've left, behind.
All that I've left.
All that I've left, behind.
All that I've left.

\textbf{Original Poem by N. Roerich}

I am prepared for the road.
All that was mine I renounced.
You will take it, my friends.
Now for the last time, I shall survey
My house. Once more

I shall view my possessions. Upon the images
Of friends I shall look once more.
For the last time.
I know already
That here nothing of mine remains.

Possessions and all that impeded me
Freely I am giving away. Without them
I shall be more free. Before the One
Who calls me, liberated
I shall appear.

Now once more
I shall survey the house. View once more
That from which I am released,
Free and liberated and firm
In thought. The images of friends and the view
Of my former things
Do not confuse me. I am going. I am hurrying.
But once more---for the
Last time I shall survey all that
I left.

\item
  The Pilgrim, as he walks upon the Road, must have the open ear, the giving hand, the silent tongue, the chastened heart, the golden voice, the rapid foot, and the open eye which sees the light. He knows he travels not alone.

{[}Verse 1{]}
In daylight's glow we tread the road of truth,
Led by the wise whose lanterns guide our feet.
No secret shadow holds within its roof;
At every turning face the self you meet.

{[} Verse 2{]}
Where hidden sins are laid in open view,
Each heart laid bare yet bound by fellowship.
No backtracking, no disdain our hands undo;
We march as one beneath the sun's clear tip.

{[} Verse 3{]}
No pilgrim walks this path with hurried pace,
Nor lingers lost in doubts that stall the way.
In fellowship we match each measured pace;
At times we lead, at times we trail the day.

{[} Verse 4{]}
Three perils three the wandering soul must shun:
A hidden face, a vessel scant and bare,
A staff unbent that serves no tie or bond.
Cast off these masks, embrace the cross we bear.

{[}Verse 5{]}
Carry, pilgrim, fire to warm the cold,
A lamp to cast truth's brightness in your soul.
A purse that flows in mercy's hands untold,
And sealed a vase of vows before the goal.

{[}Verse 6{]}
Keep open ear to every whispered plea,
Extend the hand and hush the tongue in peace.
With tempered heart and voice of harmony,
Stride swift of foot with open eye to see the light.

{[}Verse 1{]}
The Lord my Shepherd, I shall not want;
He leads me where the green pastures lie.
Beside still waters He bids me rest,
And bids my soul in peace draw nigh.

{[}Verse 2{]}
He guides my footsteps on paths of right,
That honor Him and bear His name.
Though I walk valleys veiled in night,
I dread no evil, feel no shame.

{[}Verse 3{]}
His rod and staff bring comfort near,
Their tender strength my heart secures.
In sight of foes He spreads my feast,
His grace a refuge that endures.

{[}Verse 4{]} \\
My head He anoints, my cup runs o'er
With mercy poured in measure full.
No want can rise, no thirst endure,
His love my guard, my spirit's rule.

{[}Verse 5{]} \\
Surely His goodness trails my steps,
His mercy trails me all my days.
Through dawns of joy and dusks of doubt,
His steadfast love directs my ways.

{[}Verse 6{]} \\
I dwell within His hallowed courts
Forever singing of His grace.
His boundless care, my sure abode---
My Shepherd, Lord, through time and space.
