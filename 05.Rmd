**The Nemean Lion**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke in the Council high,
“The time has come, the test is nigh.
Arm him well, let his courage be tried,
A terrible task he cannot hide.
The people cry in grief and pain,
The lion of Nemea stalks the plain.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I am That, and That am I,
No fear remains, the truth is nigh.
With naked hands, with spirit strong,
The soul prevails, the night is gone.

[Verse 2]
Through the fifth Portal Hercules came,
Armed with weapons, shield, and flame.
But in his heart a question stirred,
“What is my task? What is the word?
Why stand I here with bow and blade,
What call of need must be obeyed?”

The Master spoke: “The people plead,
The lion devours, their hearts all bleed.
Go forth, O son, their cries are true,
The beast awaits, the work is due.”

[Chorus]
I am That, and That am I,
No fear remains, the truth is nigh.
With naked hands, with spirit strong,
The soul prevails, the night is gone.

[Verse 3]
He cast aside his arms of war,
“They weigh me down, I need no more.
My club of wood, my fearless heart,
These alone shall play their part.”

The people cried: “You’ll surely fall,
The lion is death, the dread of all!”
But Hercules walked, in silence deep,
Following tracks through woods so steep.

[Bridge]
He loosed his arrows, swift and sure,
But none could pierce, the beast endured.
The lion roared, the earth it shook,
The people fled, but Hercules stood.

Into the cave the monster ran,
Two mouths of stone, a deadly plan.
He blocked one path with branches piled,
And faced the beast with courage wild.

[Verse 4]
With mighty arms he seized its throat,
The roaring ceased, no sound it spoke.
Closer still, he held it fast,
Till breath was gone, the threat was past.

The people cheered: “The lion is dead!
We till our fields, we eat our bread.
The son of man, the son of God,
Has freed our land where terror trod.”

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)

I am That, and That am I,
No fear remains, the truth is nigh.
With naked hands, with spirit strong,
The soul prevails, the night is gone.

[Outro (gentle, solemn)]
He bore the skin, the lion’s hide,
A mantle of strength, a cloak of pride.
The Master spoke: “The work is done,
Rest in peace, victorious son.”
