**The Hydra of Lerna**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke, serene and bright,
The Master heard the words of light:
“The Hydra waits in the swamp of dread,
Nine dark heads, one cannot be dead.
Strike not with force, nor weapons vain,
But learn through loss, through yielding gain.”

So Hercules passed through the Portal’s door,
To face the beast by the Amymone’s shore.

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
Warrior I am, and from the fight,
I rise in triumph, crowned with light.
Through shadowed depths, through fear’s lament,
I conquer still, by soul’s assent.

[Verse 2]
The stench of Lerna choked the air,
The bog was treacherous, foul, unfair.
By cavern’s mouth the Hydra lay,
In endless night it hid by day.

With flaming shafts he stirred its den,
It rose in wrath, beyond all ken.
Nine heads hissed, with tongues of flame,
And round his feet the coils came.

[Verse 3]
He struck one head, it fell away,
But two grew back without delay.
Again he smote, again they came,
The monster stronger, not made tame.

Then memory stirred — his Master’s word:
“We rise by kneeling, strength deferred.”
He cast aside his club of might,
And knelt to lift the beast to light.

[Chorus]
Warrior I am, and from the fight,
I rise in triumph, crowned with light.
Through shadowed depths, through fear’s lament,
I conquer still, by soul’s assent.

[Bridge]
High in the air the Hydra reeled,
Its power waned, its fate was sealed.
The sun’s pure rays, the cleansing wind,
Undid the force of thoughts that sinned.

One by one the heads fell low,
Till only the deathless head did show.
He cut it free, beneath a stone,
He buried it deep, its power gone.

[Verse 4]
Back to the Master’s side he came,
Bearing no spoil, but bearing flame.
“The Hydra’s slain, its strength undone,
The battle fought, the triumph won.”

The Master smiled: “The light you bore,
Now shines with ours forevermore.”

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
Warrior I am, and from the fight,
I rise in triumph, crowned with light.
Through shadowed depths, through fear’s lament,
I conquer still, by soul’s ascent.

[Outro (gentle, resolute)]
The Hydra’s lair lies dark no more,
The soul has triumphed, the spirit soars.
The eighth great Portal’s light is thine,
O son of man, O son divine.
