**The Man‑Eating Mares**

[Verse 1]
The Portal stood open, wide and bright,
A voice rang forth from the realm of light:
“Hercules, my son, go forth, be strong,
Enter the Path, where the trials belong.
Do the work, and when it is done,
Return to me, and tell what you’ve won.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I come forth, and from the plane of mind, I rule,
The mares are seized, the will made true.
Through shadow and pride, through trial and flame,
The mind is mastered, the soul shall reign.

[Verse 2]
With triumph he ran through the pillars tall,
Confident, proud, he would conquer all.
Beyond the gate lay Diomedes’ land,
Where war-bred horses roamed the sand.
Savage their cries, their hooves struck dread,
They trampled the sons of men till they bled.

[Pre-Chorus]
“Capture the mares, end the cruel reign,
Free this land from terror and pain.”

[Chorus]
I come forth, and from the plane of mind, I rule,
The mares are seized, the will made true.
Through shadow and pride, through trial and flame,
The mind is mastered, the soul shall reign.

[Verse 3]
“Abderis, friend, come stand by my side,
Together we’ll tame these beasts of pride.”
They planned with care, they chased with might,
Through marsh and meadow, by day, by night.
At last they trapped them, bound and tied,
And Hercules shouted in joy and pride.

[Bridge]
But pride betrayed him, he turned away,
“Lead them, my friend, through the gate today.”
Abderis faltered, weak with fear,
The mares broke loose, their rage was clear.
They struck him down, they tore, they fled,
And Hercules found his companion dead.

[Verse 4]
Humbled, grieving, he sought once more,
He caught the mares as he had before.
This time himself he bore the strain,
And led them bound through the gate again.
The people rejoiced, their fear undone,
They hailed him savior, the valiant one.
But Abderis lay silent, still,
A lesson carved by fate’s stern will.

[Final Chorus]
I come forth, and from the plane of mind, I rule,
The mares are seized, the will made true.
Through shadow and pride, through trial and flame,
The mind is mastered, the soul shall reign.

[Outro (spoken or sung softly)]
The Master spoke: “The task is done,
But poorly wrought, O my son.
Learn the lesson, be humble, be true,
Another labor awaits for you.”
