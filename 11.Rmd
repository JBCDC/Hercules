**The Augean Stables**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One in radiant flame,
Spoke of the light, one lamp, one name.
“The single fire must kindle all,
The forty-nine must hear its call.”

The Master turned and summoned near:
“Hercules, the time is here.
Turn back, retrace, the world implore,
Bring light to those who see no more.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
Water of life am I,
Poured forth for thirsty men.
I cleanse the darkened fields,
And make them bloom again.

[Verse 2]
Through the eleventh gate he came,
To Augias’ land of grief and shame.
The stench of years, the filth, the blight,
Had robbed the fields of seed and light.

The king received him, full of doubt:
“No man can cleanse this waste throughout.
If in one day you make it plain,
A tenth of my herds shall be your gain.”

[Verse 3]
Hercules left, in silence deep,
He saw the carts of death that creep.
The pestilence had claimed its due,
The land lay barren, choked, untrue.

Two rivers flowed, the Alpheus near,
And Peneus winding, cool and clear.
He seized their streams with labor vast,
And through the stables forced them past.

[Chorus]
Water of life am I,
Poured forth for thirsty men.
I cleanse the darkened fields,
And make them bloom again.

[Bridge]
The torrents roared, the filth was gone,
The land was cleansed, the dawn was drawn.
In one swift day the work was done,
The stables shone beneath the sun.

But Augias raged: “This was a trick!
The rivers worked, your hands were slick.
No prize is yours, no herds, no throne,
Begone, or lose your head, your own!”

[Verse 4]
Banished, yet triumphant still,
Hercules bowed to the Master’s will.

“You served the world, though scorned, denied,
You turned the flood, the filth defied.
You’ve learned to shine by turning back,
To fill the void, supply the lack.
The jewel won is yours to keep,
The light you pour is strong and deep.”

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
Water of life am I,
Poured forth for thirsty men.
I cleanse the darkened fields,
And make them bloom again.

[Outro (gentle, luminous)]
The rivers flow, the land is free,
The server shines in purity.
The eleventh gate is passed, the flame
Now lights the world in Hercules’ name.
