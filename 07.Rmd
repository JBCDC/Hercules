**The Erymanthian Boar**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke in the Council above:
“He must learn balance, judgment, and love.
Prepare him now for a sterner test,
That he may serve mankind the best.”

The Master wrote the trial’s decree,
And sent his word across the sea:
“Go forth, my son, the boar restrain,
But take your time, and strength regain.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I choose the way, the middle course,
Between the two great lines of force.
Through shadowed trial, through friend and foe,
The path of balance I shall know.

[Verse 2]
Through the seventh gate he strode with might,
The sign of power burned with light.
Apollo gave a bow of flame,
But Hercules refused the same:

“In my last task I killed and tore,
This time I’ll slay no more.
I’ll climb unarmed, with club in hand,
And seek the boar across the land.”

[Verse 3]
Upon the path a centaur friend,
Pholos, called him to attend.
They broke the cask that was not theirs,
And drank with laughter, free of cares.

But other centaurs, fierce, enraged,
In battle wild their fury waged.
And once again, with grief and shame,
Hercules slew those he should not maim.

[Chorus]
I choose the way, the middle course,
Between the two great lines of force.
Through shadowed trial, through friend and foe,
The path of balance I shall know.

[Bridge]
He climbed the heights where snow winds bite,
He tracked the boar through the star-lit night.
He set a snare with patient art,
And waited still with watchful heart.

At dawn the beast, with hunger sore,
Stumbled into the trap he bore.
With mighty hands he seized its frame,
And bent its fury to his aim.

[Verse 4]
Down from the mountain, laughing, free,
He dragged the boar for all to see.
By hind legs bound, the beast obeyed,
And through the streets the people swayed.

They laughed to see the hero’s song,
The boar subdued, yet dragged along.
And Hercules, with joy and cheer,
Returned to the Master who drew him near.

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
I choose the way, the middle course,
Between the two great lines of force.
Through shadowed trial, through friend and foe,
The path of balance I shall know.

[Outro (gentle, reflective)]
The Presiding One spoke: “The lesson is clear,
Balance is won, yet more draws near.
Twice you have slain what you should love,
Learn the reason, O son of God.”
