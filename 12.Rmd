**The Red Cattle of Geryon and the Holy Grail**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One in the Council spoke,
“The circle nears, the chain is broke.
Lost and found, through death, through pain,
The server saves, the light shall reign.

"The final Portal waits ahead,
Where Geryon rules, where fears are fed.
Bring back the herd, the crimson flame,
And write forever the victor’s name.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I leave the Father’s home,
And turning back, I save.
Through sea and fire I roam,
Through trial fierce and grave.
The herd I serve, the path I brave,
I leave the Father’s home,
And turning back, I save.

[Verse 2]
To Helios’ shrine he bowed in prayer,
Seven days of silence there.
The god of fire bestowed a sign,
A golden chalice, Grail divine.

Within its light he crossed the sea,
To Erythia’s shore, his destiny.
The red herd grazed, the watch-dogs came,
Two-headed Ortros, fierce with flame.

[Verse 3]
The beast leapt forth with snapping jaws,
But Hercules struck with righteous cause.
The shepherd begged, his life was spared,
The herd was gathered, driven, cared.

Yet dust arose, the earth did quake,
Three-bodied Geryon was awake.
With fiery breath and lances thrown,
The monster claimed the herd his own.

[Chorus]
I leave the Father’s home,
And turning back, I save.
Through sea and fire I roam,
Through trial fierce and grave.
The herd I serve, the path I brave,
I leave the Father’s home,
And turning back, I save.

[Bridge (Battle with Geryon)]
The arrow blazed, the bow was drawn,
It pierced three bodies, struck as one.
A cry of anguish split the sky,
The tyrant fell, no more to rise.

The herd was free, the path was clear,
Yet long the road, through lands severe.
Through Alps and valleys, foes he faced,
And justice rose where wrongs were placed.

[Verse 4]
At times he strayed, yet turned again,
Retraced his steps through toil and pain.
Through weary miles the herd he drove,
Till reached at last the Sacred Grove.

The Master stood with arms outstretched,
“The circle’s closed, the goal is fetched.
The jewel of immortality shines,
The name of Hercules in the stars aligns.”

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
I leave the Father’s home,
And turning back, I save.
Through sea and fire I roam,
Through trial fierce and grave.

The herd I serve, the path I brave,
I leave the Father’s home,
And turning back, I save.

[Outro (gentle, triumphant)]
The labors end, the soul ascends,
The servant’s path in glory bends.
The human done, the cosmic near,
The voice resounds: “Well done, appear.”
