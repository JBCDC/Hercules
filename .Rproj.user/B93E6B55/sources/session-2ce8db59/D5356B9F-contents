**The Cretan Bull**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke to the Master of Light:
“Where is the man who once stood in our sight?
He entered the first gate, received our gift,
But now he mourns, his spirit adrift.”

The Master replied: “He grieves his friend,
Yet seeks within for strength to mend.”

“Then let him rise, and once more fight,
Through the second Portal, into the light.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I see, and when the Eye is opened, all is light,
Desire is mastered, the soul shines bright.
Through shadow and sorrow, through trial and pain,
The bull is captured, the spirit shall reign.

[Verse 2]
Alone and weary, with sorrow deep,
Through the second gate he made his leap.
Beyond the sea lay Crete’s fair land,
Where Minos ruled with iron hand.

The sacred bull roamed fierce and free,
Its star-crowned brow a lamp to see.
Through maze and meadow, shore to shore,
Hercules chased it, evermore.

[Chorus]
I see, and when the Eye is opened, all is light,
Desire is mastered, the soul shines bright.
Through shadow and sorrow, through trial and pain,
The bull is captured, the spirit shall reign.

[Bridge]
The Seven Sisters sang above,
Guiding his steps with songs of love.
Across the waves the bull he rode,
Toward the Temple’s shining road.

The Cyclopes three stood watching near,
Their voices rang for all to hear:
“Who comes with strength across the foam,
And drives the bull toward sacred home?”

[Verse 3]
“I am the son of Hera’s line,
A son of man, yet child divine.
By inner light, by Master’s word,
I sought the bull, my task conferred.
Through toil and trial, pain and flame,
I bring it here in the Holy Name.”

The Three received it, safe at last,
The danger ended, the trial past.

[Final Chorus (repeat, crescendo)]
I see, and when the Eye is opened, all is light,
Desire is mastered, the soul shines bright.
Through shadow and sorrow, through trial and pain,
The bull is captured, the spirit shall reign.

[Outro (spoken or sung softly)]
“Within the light, thou shalt see light,
Walk in that radiance, ever bright.
The second labor is complete,
Rise, O Hercules, the third to meet.”
