**The Golden Apples**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One watched from the Council above,
He saw the disciple prepare with resolve.
The third great Portal opened wide,
A chance to walk with steadfast stride.

“Guard the tree where wisdom grows,
Test his strength through highs and lows.
Let him seek, though the path be long,
With patient heart and spirit strong.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I recognise my other self,
And in its waning, I grow and glow.
The golden fruit of truth is won,
The light within begins to show.

[Verse 2]
Far away in a radiant land,
The sacred tree of wisdom stands.
Upon its boughs the apples gleam,
Desired by all who dare to dream.
Three maidens guard with watchful eyes,
A hundred-headed dragon lies.

The Master warned: “Be wise, beware,
Of force too great, of snares too rare.
Five tests await along the way,
Learn their lessons, do not stray.”

[Chorus]
I recognise my other self,
And in its waning, I grow and glow.
The golden fruit of truth is won,
The light within begins to show.

[Bridge]
“O Master of my soul,” he cried,
“Show me the path, the shortest guide!
I seek the apples, swift and sure,
For my own gain, I would endure.”

The Master spoke: “Not so, my son,
The path is long, the work hard-won.
Seek not the quick, nor grasp too fast,
The fruit is guarded, the trial will last.”

[Verse 3]
Through trials five his steps must go,
Through shadowed tests the light will grow.
Each challenge holds a hidden key,
To wisdom, skill, and mastery.

The dragon waits, the maidens stand,
The apples gleam in that far land.
But Hercules must learn to see,
That self must fade for truth to be.

[Final Chorus (repeat, crescendo)]
I recognise my other self,
And in its waning, I grow and glow.
The golden fruit of truth is won,
The light within begins to show.

[Outro (gentle, fading)]
The apples shine, the path is clear,
The soul grows bright, the self grows near.
Through patient steps the seeker knows,
In waning self, the spirit glows.
