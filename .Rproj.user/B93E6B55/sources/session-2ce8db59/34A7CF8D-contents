**The Girdle of Hippolyta**

[Verse 1]
The Presiding One spoke in the Council of flame:
“Is the son of man prepared once again?
A trial new, of a different kind,
To test his heart, his soul, his mind?”

The Master replied: “He will not delay,
When called to labor, he’ll walk the Way.”

[Chorus (Keynote refrain)]
I am the mother and the child,
I, God, I, matter am.
Through death and life, through grief and strife,
The two are one, the whole I am.

[Verse 2]
On the shores of the sea the Amazons reigned,
A queen of women, by none constrained.
In the temple of the moon they prayed,
To Mars, the god of war, they laid.

Upon her waist the girdle shone,
A gift of Venus, love’s own throne.
A symbol of unity, struggle, and birth,
The sacred child, the hope of earth.

[Verse 3]
Hippolyta stood with her warriors near,
“Hercules comes, the hour is here.
Shall I obey, and yield this sign,
Or fight the will of the Lord divine?”

Before her came the son of man,
But deaf to her words, he raised his hand.
He seized the girdle, the gift she gave,
And struck her down, her life to save.

[Chorus]
I am the mother and the child,
I, God, I, matter am.
Through death and life, through grief and strife,
The two are one, the whole I am.

[Bridge]
The Master cried: “Why slay the one
Who offered love, whose task was done?
Why kill the mother, the giver of grace,
The keeper of life, the child’s own place?
Redeem thy deed, O son of man,
Seek again thy Master’s plan.”

[Verse 4]
By the rocky shore a monster rose,
With Hesione caught in its dreadful throes.
Her cries of terror pierced the sky,
Hercules heard, and leapt to try.

Into the beast’s dark throat he came,
With sword of light, through blood and flame.
He found the maiden, held her fast,
And carved a path to the day at last.

[Final Chorus (crescendo, repeat)]
I am the mother and the child,
I, God, I, matter am.
Through death and life, through grief and strife,
The two are one, the whole I am.

[Outro (gentle, solemn)]
The girdle won, the maiden freed,
Through death and life he learned the need.
The Master spoke: “The work is done,
Rest, O Hercules, victorious son.”
